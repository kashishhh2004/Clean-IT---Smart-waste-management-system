 PROBLEM STATEMENT : A system for citizens to report unclean areas in their Municipal corporation, helping authorities prioritize and execute clean-up efforts effectively.  Revolutionizing Waste Management: Clean City, Green City!
Our innovative Garbage Report and Management System is here to transform how we handle waste. With real-time reporting and smart management, we empower communities to maintain cleaner environments. Join us in taking the first step towards a sustainable future—because a cleaner world starts with smarter solutions.
Presenting to you – Clean IT, a project that aims to bridge that gap by introducing a Smart Garbage Reporting System, where citizens can easily report instances of garbage by taking pictures and uploading them through a user-friendly platform. Once a report is submitted, the municipal corporation receives the data and takes prompt action to clean the area.
KEY FEATURES OF CLEAN IT
Real-Time Image Uploading:
Users can instantly capture and upload images of garbage in their locality through the app or website. This real-time feature ensures that the garbage is reported as soon as it's identified, enabling quicker municipal response times.
GPS Map Integration for Location Tracking:
The system uses GPS to accurately track and pinpoint the location of the reported garbage. This feature ensures that municipal authorities can easily locate the problem area for swift cleanup and waste management.
Automated Report Generation:
Once an image is uploaded and the location is tagged, the system automatically generates a detailed report that is sent to the relevant municipal authority.
